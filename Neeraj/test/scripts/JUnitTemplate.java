		 driver.close and driver.quit are two different methods for closing
		 the browser session in Selenium WebDriver. Understanding both of them
		 and knowing when to use each method is important in your test
		 execution. Therefore, I have tried to shed some light on both of
		 these methods.
		
		 driver.close - This method closes the browser window on which the
		 focus is set.
		
		 driver.quit – This method basically calls driver.dispose a now
		 internal method which in turn closes all of the browser windows and
		 ends the WebDriver session gracefully.It is used to shut down the web
		 driver instance or destroy the web driver instance
		
		 driver.dispose - As mentioned previously, is an internal method of
		 WebDriver which has been silently dropped according to another answer
		 - Verification needed. This method really doesn't have a use-case in
		 a normal test workflow as either of the previous methods should work
		 for most use cases.
		
		 Explanation use case: You should use driver.quit whenever you want to
		 end the program. It will close all opened browser windows and
		 terminates the WebDriver session. If you do not use driver.quit at
		 the end of the program, the WebDriver session will not close properly
		 and files would not be cleared from memory. This may result in memory
		 leak errors.
		
		 The above explanation should explain the difference between
		 driver.close and driver.quit methods in WebDriver. I hope you find it
		 useful.
